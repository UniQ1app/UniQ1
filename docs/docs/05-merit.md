# Merit Layer — Identity & Reputation

The Merit Layer represents the persistent identity of each user in UNIQ.

It is not a social profile.
It is a verifiable record of contribution, learning, and reliability.

---

## UniQ ID

Each user has a UniQ ID displaying:
- Qualification level
- Learning progress
- Contribution history
- Reliability indicators

This profile is visible across all interfaces.

---

## Merit Components

Merit is composed of:
- Completed learning modules
- Exam results
- Community participation
- Contribution validation (content, mentoring, missions)

Merit is non-transferable.
It cannot be bought or sold.

---

## Reputation vs Popularity

- No follower counts
- No likes
- No influence without contribution

Authority emerges from verified actions only.

---

## Legacy & History

The Merit Layer keeps a permanent history of:
- Past roles
- Certifications
- Long-term participation

This prevents short-term opportunism.

## Phase 1 Limitation

In Phase 1:
- Merit is stored off-chain
- No financial power is linked to Merit
- Profiles are informational only

Phase 2 connects Merit to on-chain governance and staking.
