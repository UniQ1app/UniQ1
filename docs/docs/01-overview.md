# UNIQ — Project Overview

UNIQ (Universal Network for Information & Qualification) is a merit-based web application built on top of the Qubic ecosystem.

This repository (Phase 1) contains the NON-BLOCKCHAIN version of UNIQ.
It focuses on:
- Education
- Information validation
- Community structuring
- Merit visualization

No tokens, no smart contracts, no on-chain logic exist in this repository.

## User Journey

1. The user arrives on the public Intelligence Hub (no login).
2. The user learns about Qubic through verified information.
3. The user can enter the Academy to learn and be tested.
4. The user interacts with the community in a structured way.
5. The user builds a visible merit profile.

## What This Repository Is NOT

- Not a wallet
- Not a DEX
- Not a blockchain
- Not handling real funds

All blockchain logic is handled in a separate repository: UNIQ-Phase2-Qubic.

## Philosophy

UNIQ is not designed to maximize engagement.
It is designed to maximize clarity, competence, and long-term alignment.

Truth > Virality  
Merit > Popularity  
Structure > Chaos
