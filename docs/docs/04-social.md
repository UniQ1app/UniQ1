# Social Hub — Structured Community Layer

The Social Hub is the communication layer of UNIQ.
Its purpose is to enable learning, mentorship, and coordination without noise.

This is not a free-for-all chat.
Structure and clarity are enforced by design.

## Core Features

### 1. Mentorship Zones

Users can ask questions in categorized spaces:
- Beginner Questions
- Technical Clarifications
- Ecosystem Guidance

Higher-ranked users act as Relays (mentors).

---

### 2. Rank Visibility

Each user message displays:
- Learning status
- Qualification level (Aspirant / Qualified / Expert)

This avoids confusion between opinions and expertise.

---

### 3. AI Assistance

AI supports the Social Hub by:
- Suggesting accurate responses to mentors
- Linking questions to existing documentation
- Detecting repeated misinformation patterns

The AI does not replace humans.
It augments clarity and speed.

---

### 4. Anti-FUD Design

- No anonymous posting
- No virality mechanics
- No reaction farming

Low-quality or misleading discussions naturally lose visibility.

## Phase 1 Limitation

In Phase 1:
- Messages are off-chain
- No moderation slashing exists
- AI assistance is advisory only
