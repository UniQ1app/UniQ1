# UNIQ — Universal Network for Information & Qualification

UNIQ is a merit-based application layer built on top of the Qubic ecosystem.

Its purpose is to educate, qualify, structure, and reward contributors who actively strengthen the clarity, adoption, and long-term resilience of Qubic.

UNIQ is not a social network.
UNIQ is not a media platform.
UNIQ is not a speculative product.

UNIQ is a Merit Engine.

## Core Principles

- Merit over money  
- Contribution over status  
- Validation over visibility  
- Long-term alignment over speculation  

Influence is earned through verified action, not capital.

## Project Structure

This repository contains **Phase 1** of the UNIQ project.

### Phase 1 — Web Application (Off-chain)

This phase is designed for **standard developers**  
(No blockchain knowledge required)

It includes:
- A public Intelligence Hub (anti-FUD, information clarity)
- An Academy (learning & qualification)
- A structured Social layer (mentorship, Q&A)
- A Governance interface (visual only, no on-chain power)
- A Merit-based identity profile

All logic in this repository is **off-chain**.
